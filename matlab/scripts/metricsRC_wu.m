function    RCsignif = metricsRC_wu(SC, ci, rcPerm, nPerm)
% function metricsRC_wu, gets called in metricsGlobal_wu
% SC = mean structural connectivity matrix
% ci = set of ca 19 individual connectivity matrices
% rcperm = set of rich-club vectors per permutated matrix: rcDim x noPermMatrices
% nPerm = number of group permutations to be performed

% tests significance of rich-club via permutation testing
% p-value 0.05, one-sided
